# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System
In this project we aim to build an automated system using Face Recognition that replace the traditional methods of Attendance taking.

I have used mobile camera as a webcam with the help of IP Webcam app. If you also want to use your mobile as webcam, you can do it by using IP Webcam or DroidCam app. These apps will give you an IP address that you have to put in the code, but your mobile should be in the same network of laptop/PC.
